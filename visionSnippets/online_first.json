{"meta":{"title":"Online First","order_prop":2},"content":"<p>Online academic education is currently mainly offered in the form of Massive Open Online Courses. There is a reasonable fear, however, that the lack of individual feedback and direct interaction in those MOOC will lead to a decay of quality of education and scholarship.</p>\n<p>We believe, that a more creative use of online teaching and learning environments can actually help us educate both larger numbers of students as well as give more attention to the individual student. We call this approach <strong>online first</strong>. It offers the following elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Online learning exercises with behaviour-driven feedback</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Collaborative assignments </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Peer-feedback in small groups, via an online platform and offline meetings </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Large Q&amp;A sessions where students get direct feedback from teachers </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Detailed metrics of the course to monitor progress of individual students and groups of students</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}
