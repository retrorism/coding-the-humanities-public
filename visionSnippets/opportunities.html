<p>Programming offers opportunities for new kinds of collaborative work. Larger research projects no longer need to be divided into several topics or objects, but people can divide labor through different tasks and skill sets, using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship. </p>
<p>The various research techniques that will be explored in our course are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>imaging, translation, mapping</p>
<p>example: <a href="http://boschproject.org/">Bosch project</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>visualization, filtering, searching</p>
<p>example: <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo">New York Times Guantanamo project</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>publishing, linking</p>
<p>example: <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/about">Public Knowledge Project</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>crowdsourcing, annotation, translation</p>
<p>example: <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/project/ancientlives">Zooniverse - Lives of the ancient Greeks</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of large scale collaborative projects will make the humanities more attractive for external funding.</p>
