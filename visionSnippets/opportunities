Programming offers opportunities for new kinds of collaborative work. Larger research projects no longer need to be divided into several topics or objects, but people can divide labor through different tasks and skill sets, using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship. 

The various research techniques that will be explored in our course are:

+ imaging, translation, mapping

  example: [Bosch project](http://boschproject.org/) 

+ visualization, filtering, searching

  example: [New York Times Guantanamo project](http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo)

+ publishing, linking

  example: [Public Knowledge Project](http://pkp.sfu.ca/about)

+ crowdsourcing, annotation, translation

  example: [Zooniverse - Lives of the ancient Greeks](https://www.zooniverse.org/project/ancientlives)

This kind of large scale collaborative projects will make the humanities more attractive for external funding.
