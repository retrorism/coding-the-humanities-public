<p>Students and scholars in the humanities generally rely on prefabricated tools to guide and instruct their learning and research. We are reluctant to engage with technology through coding. This remains a major distinction between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences design, create and maintain their own digital research environments and tools, while the humanities make do with prefabricated, and often inappropriate, tools. </p>
<p>At the moment, there are no broadly available academic programming courses aimed at humanities scholars. For various reasons, however, coding skills are needed now more than ever, and even more so in the future: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge of programming helps students and researchers to understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Developing custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality) of its output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is an ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for academics who can read and write code.</p>
